passport-stormpath
==================

passport-stormpath is a strategy for `Passport`_ that makes it *incredibly*
simple to add users and user data to your application.  It aims to completely
abstract away all user registration, login, authentication, and authorization
problems, and make building secure websites painless.  And the best part?
**You don't even need a database!**

.. note::
    Passport.js is purely for authentication (i.e. checking that someone's
    username and password is valid, or getting their identity from a social
    provider). It is not designed for handling user registrations, manage
    password resets, or implement email verification workflows, etc.  In turn,
    our Passport strategy only automates authentication.  If you need to do more, like password reset, you'll need to also use the `Stormpath Node SDK`_.

    For a more seamless and automated experience, check out 
    our `Express-Stormpath`_ library instead of Passport.js. It provides a full suite of user management features for your Express-based web application:

    - Create, register and authenticate users.
    - Store custom user data with each account.
    - Create and assign permissions (groups, roles, etc.).
    - Handle complex authentication and authorization patterns, like multi-tenancy.
    - Log users in via social login with Facebook and Google OAuth.
    - Cache user information for quick access.
    - Secure all your passwords.
    - Automate all your password reset and account verification workflows.
